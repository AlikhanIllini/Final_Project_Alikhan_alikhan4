# Ideas & Selection Rationale
- Assignment ideas: Stock Cards Lite
- Final ideas: Stock Cards — Ultimate
- Selected: Stock Cards Lite (Assignment), Stock Cards — Ultimate (Final)
- Why: same domain, scoped growth; minimal re-learning

# Wireframe Notes
- Goal of v1 wireframes (Ultimate): Keep the Lite flow, add auth, tags, saved filters, and room for weekly email digest.
- Screens included:
    - login: required here (multi-user).
    - dashboard: card grid + tags and saved filter dropdown.
    - create/edit card: same core fields as Lite; add tags; get "last price" using API.
    - empty/error: first-run + validation/network.

# Branching Strategy
- Strategy chosen: Simple Gitflow (same as Lite) with extra feature branches.
    - main (protected), develop, feature/, release/, hotfix/.

 - Planned feature branches (Ultimate adds on top of Lite):
    - feature/auth -> feature/tags -> feature/price-adapter -> feature/saved-filters -> feature/digest-email
    - Continue to use: feature/models, feature/crud, feature/ui, feature/reporting

# Django Setup
- startproject folder name chosen: appserver; app name: cards — simple and clear.

# Virtual Environment Choice
- Using Python venv because it's simple and works with PyCharm auto-detect.
