Stock Cards - Final Project Reflection
======================================

KEY LESSONS LEARNED
• Django's MTV architecture provides excellent separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend the codebase
• External API integration requires robust error handling and fallback mechanisms - users expect reliability even when third-party services fail
• User experience matters as much as functionality - the card-based interface makes complex data more approachable
• Proper data modeling upfront saves significant refactoring time later - designing the relationships between Users, Stocks, Cards, Tags, and PriceSnapshots was crucial

CHALLENGES FACED
• API Rate Limiting: Yahoo Finance's free tier has strict limits, requiring implementation of caching (15-minute) and manual price entry fallback
• Multi-User Data Isolation: Ensuring each user only sees their own cards and tags required careful queryset filtering throughout the views
• Email Configuration: Setting up the weekly digest required understanding Django's email backends and deciding on console output for development/demo purposes
• Deployment: Configuring the app for production (static files, database, environment variables) had a learning curve

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
• Add real-time WebSocket updates for live price streaming
• Implement portfolio analytics with charts and graphs (using Chart.js or D3.js)
• Add export functionality (CSV/PDF) for stock cards and price history
• Integrate additional data sources (news feeds, analyst ratings)
• Build a mobile app using Django REST Framework as the backend API
